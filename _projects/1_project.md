We introduce GeomFum, an open-source Python library for machine learning and deep learning on functional maps, a powerful representation for shape analysis and correspondence.
The library provides object-oriented, modular, and extensively tested implementations for functional maps and related operators. It includes tools for computing and learning spectral bases, map refinement, and higher-level tasks such as shape matching, segmentation,
and classification using functional representations. Core operations are vectorized for batch processing and support multiple backends, including NumPy, PyTorch, and Autograd.
This project presents the GeomFum package, positions it relative to existing libraries, and provides illustrative code examples.
By offering a unified framework for learning with functional maps, GeomFum aims to accelerate research in geometric deep learning and democratize functional representations in computer vision and 3D shape analysis.
