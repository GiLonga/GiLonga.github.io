#Hey! I’m Giorgio, a researcher specializing in AI and geometry processing,
#focused on bridging theoretical advancements to real-world applications. [subreddit](http://reddit.com). 
#You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

**Hey there!** This is my personal page, I’m Giorgio Longari. 
I graduated in Mathematical Engineering at Technical University of Milan (2024), and currently I'm a [researcher](https://www.unimib.it/giorgio-longari) at the Department of Informatic, Systems, and Communications at the University of Milano-Bicocca.

My reserch focuses on **Geometry Processing**, **Computer Vision** and **Machine Learning**, with real world applications, particularly in the medical field.
I’m part of the DigAir research group, working under the supervision of Prof. [Simone Melzi](https://sites.google.com/site/melzismn).

I also maintain active collaborations with academic institutions such as [UC Santa Barbara](https://gi.ece.ucsb.edu/) and [University of Verona](https://www.dimi.univr.it/?lang=en), as well as with Research Hospitals like [IRCSS Humanitas](https://www.hunimed.eu/) and [IRCSS E. Medea](https://emedea.it/medea/en/research/topics/cesne-neuroimaging-lab).

After my research experience, I decided to give myself the chance to further study and explore Geometric Deep Learning and Spectral Shape Analysis, with the goal of contributing to this community through my work.
For this reason I'm **Looking for a PhD opportunity!**
